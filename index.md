### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 was one of my favorite labs as I liked both parts. Part 1 had to do with filtering through a vector using for loops and if statements, which allowed me to become comfortable with using both. The second part had to do with taking numbers from the command line and averaging them out. I really enjoyed this lab as a whole because it made me more comfortable with using vectors, for loops, and if statements, as well as taking parameters from the command line.

* Lab 8
    
    Lab 8 was another lab that I favored. I really liked part-1 which had to do with using nested loops to print a pattern to the console. This part got me comfortable with using nested loops and being able to trace loops in general. Part-2 was also interesting as it felt like a culmination of what we had previously learned. 

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 was another lab that I favored. Part-1 had to do with creating functions to calculate a rectangles area. I enjoyed this part as it was fairly easy. Part-2, which I really enjoyed, had to do with 2D Vectors. This lab helped me understand 2D vectors and made me comfortable with using them.
